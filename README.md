# cloud-itonami-7810

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC Rev.5 7810**: employment agency — candidate intake, matching, placement and follow-up.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for community employment agency:
run by a qualified operator so a community keeps its own operating records
instead of renting a closed SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a screening and logistics robot performs resume intake, matching and placement logistics under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Employment Agency Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
handling sensitive candidate data and high-stakes placement decisions) require human sign-off.

## Core Contract

```text
intake + identity + identity records
        |
        v
Advisor -> Employment Agency Governor -> proceed, hold, or human approval
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.
