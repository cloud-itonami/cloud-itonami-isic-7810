  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the community-employment-agency
  actor.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- candidacy intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-assess  -- adds jurisdiction assessment writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:candidacy/intake` (no candidate-
                                 facing risk yet) may auto-commit.
                                 `:candidacy/match`/`:candidacy/place`
                                 NEVER auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:candidacy/match`/`:candidacy/place` are deliberately ABSENT from
  every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Matching a
  real candidate to a job and placing a real candidate into a job are
  the two real-world acts this actor performs; both are always a
  human agency operator's call. `employmentops.governor`'s
  `:actuation/match-candidate`/`:actuation/place-candidate` high-
  stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this. Like every prior sibling's phase 3
  `:auto` set, this domain has only ONE member (`:candidacy/intake`)
  -- no separate no-candidate-facing-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct
  from the candidacy itself.")
